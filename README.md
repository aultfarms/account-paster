How do I want this to work?

- starting inventory can just be a card with JSON in the description
- ignore all in/out cards prior to starting inventory
- how to deal with pricing/checks?
  * maybe I only want the pricing info when I'm at computer, so drag in
    checks spreadsheet?
  * I want this to work on my phone, but I want spreadsheet to be excel?
  * if spreadsheet is google sheets then it's queryable
  * maybe that means I need to get google drive sync back running again
  * so an option is keep some stuff in google drive as google sheets,
    and other stuff in trello
- the app should be able to give inventory numbers like count and projections
  without the google sheet.  connect up google sheets and it will fill in 
  checks info to give target sale prices, tax info
- app can download/export a google sheet that has all the fifo info in it
  like the current speadsheet
- app should track tag numbers from groups and remove knon dead ones
  from their groups
- app could use numbers from weights sheet to remove calves from their 
  groups too
- going to need "tax mode" and "most accurate mode"


==> decided to make switch to google sheets
